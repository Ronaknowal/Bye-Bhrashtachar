### #Inspirstion
We have been inspired by the real life events where one encounter with police.
Now, some of the police are now have been courrupted they create such a situation where they transact illeagel money without reason
So, now are up here with our project which is directly linked to the government's server and helps you to keep an eye on your challan, fine as you will be able to fill those fines here or can show some legitimate document by uploading online on this portal to safe guard your side; also this will help to store your important documents. So when everything will be conducted online their will be reduction in the corruption rate on the daily basis especialy in police department. 
### #What it does
It will Notify, Store, Sort, Alert and Save your time and money and will  help reducing corrruption as we will need no extra moneys to be paid to our irregular system.

- It will **Notify** us about our dues, taxes, fines that are required to pay to the government.
- It will **Alert** us about new rules, will alert about new fines or the charges that are applied on us by government officials. Also it will display if you have any another way  chance to nullify that charge like by submitting some document.
- Also it will **Sort** you dues according to priority and deadline to pay them, also it will display number of leagal ways that you will able to proceed with that particualr problem.
- It will **Store** our important documents and will auto submit (if uploaded) the document whenever it is asked or you will be able to show it at any place and access the document also.

Auto submisssion of required documents, sorting of dues, alerting, and this happening in online mode which is trackable will save your money and time.

Mereko nahi pata tumlog likh dena ye neeche wala bhi
### #Challenges we ran into

We might not say we have found a way to tackel courruption but yes we have found one way to reduce it.

Also this was our little try to have some regularity in our irregular system and also transparency in it.
